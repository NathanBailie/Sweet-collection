# Sweet collection

## Description
This is a beautiful picture plugin written in native JavaScript language. An idea for this project I have found from 30 day [challenge] (https://javascript30.com/) where you complete 1 project each day in vanilla JavaScript and from a programming [marathon] (https://result.school/products/marathon-js) that Result School created.
